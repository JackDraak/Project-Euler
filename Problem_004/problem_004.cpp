Problem 4
Largest palindrome product

    A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
    The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

This is a W.I.P. solution, please solve the problem yourself before you review my code.
